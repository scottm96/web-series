            When the night has come
            And the land is dark
            And the moon is the only light we'll see
            No I won't be afraid
            Oh, I won't be afraid
            Just as long as you stand, stand by me

            So darling, darling
            Stand by me, oh stand by me
            Oh stand, stand by me
            Stand by me

            If the sky that we look upon
            Should tumble and fall
            Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
            I won't cry, I won't cry
            No, I won't shed a tear
            Just as long as you stand, stand by me

            And darling, darling
            Stand by me, oh stand by me
            Oh stand now, stand by me
            Stand by me
            
            Darling, darling
            Stand by me, oh stand by me
            Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me
            Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
            Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand
            Stand by me...
